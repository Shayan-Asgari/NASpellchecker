Life, I wonder
Will it take me under I do not know

Imagine smoking weed in the streets without cops harassin
Imagine going to court with no trial
Lifestyle cruising blue Bahama waters
No welfare supporters more conscious of the way we raise our daughters
Days are shorter nights are colder
Feeling like life is over, these snakes strike like a cobra
The world is hot my son got knocked evidently
It is elementary, they want us all gone eventually
Trooping out of state for a plate knowledge
if coke was cooked without the garbage we'd all have the top dollars
Imagine everybody flashing, fashion
Designer clothes, lacing your clique up with diamond Role's
Your people holdin dough, no parole
No rubbers, goin raw imagine law with no undercover
Just some thoughts for the mind
I take a glimpse into time
watch the blimp read The World Is Mine

If I ruled the world Imagine that
I would free all my sons, I love them love them baby
Black diamonds and pearls Could it be, if you could
be mine, we'd both shine
If I ruled the world Still livin for today, in
these last days and times

Yo it will be, paradise life relaxin black, latino and anglo-saxon
Armani exchange the reins
Cash, Lost Tribe of Shabazz, free at last
Brand new whips to crash then we laugh in the illa path
The Villa houses for the crew, how we do
Trees for breakfast, dime sexes and Benz stretches
So many years of depression make me vision
The better livin, type of place to raise kids in
Open they eyes to the lies history is told foul
But I am as wise as the old owl, plus the Gold Child
Seeing things like I was controlling, clique rollin
Tricking six digits on kicks and still holdin
Trips to Paris, I civilized every savage
Give me one shot I turn strife life to lavish
Political prisonner set free, stress free
No work release purple M3's and jet skis
Feel the wind breeze in West Indies
I make Coretta Scott-King mayor the cities and reverse fiends to Willies
It sounds foul but every girl I meet will go downtown
I would open every cell in Attica send em to Africa

If I ruled the world Imagine that
I would free all my sons, I love them love them baby
Black diamonds and pearls Could it be, if you could
be mine, we'd both shine
If I ruled the world Still livin for today, in
these last days and times

And then we will walk right up to the sun
Hand in hand
We will walk right up to the sun
We would not land
We will walk right up to the sun
Hand in hand
We will walk right up to the sun
We would not land

You'd love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry
Duck down in car seats, heat's mandatory
Runnin from Jake, gettin chased, hunger for papes
These are the breaks many mistakes go down out of state
Wait, I had to let it marinate we carry weight
Tryin to get laced, flip the ace stack the safe
Millionaire plan to keep the gat with the cocked hammer
Makin moves in Atlanta, back and forth scrambler
Cause you could have all the chips, be poor or rich
Still nobody want a brother havin it
If I ruled the world and everything in it, sky is the limit
I push an Infinity
It would not be no such thing as jealousies or felonies
Strictly living longevity to the destiny
I thought I would never see but reality struck
Better find out before your time's out, what the

If I ruled the world Imagine that
I would free all my sons, I love them baby
Black diamonds and pearls Could it be, if you could
be mine, we would both shine
If I ruled the world Still livin for today, in
these last days and times

If I ruled the world, if I ruled, if I ruled Imagine that
I would free all my sons, if I ruled, if I ruled
I love em love em baby
Black diamonds and pearls, black diamonds Could it be, if you could
black diamonds be mine, we'd both shine
If I ruled the world Still livin for today, in
these last days and times

If I ruled the world, if I ruled
if I ruled, I'd free all my sons
black diamonds, I love them love them baby
Black diamonds and pearls, if I ruled
If I ruled the world

If I ruled the world
I love them baby
